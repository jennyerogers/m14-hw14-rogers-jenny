      <h2 class="aboutstuff"> About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello! My name is Jenny Rogers, and I am a fourth-year public relations student at the University of Florida. I am an out-of-state student from Memphis, Tennessee, so, I have come a long way from home to pursue my undergraduate degree and now a master's degree at UF. </p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2 class="hobbiesinterests"> Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>Art has always been a passion of mine. Whether it's music, visual arts, film or crafts, I've always had a knack for creative mediums that allow me to express myself. </p>
      <p>As I have grown older, I have only delved further into my love for the arts, cultivating my taste for my favorite bands, movies and artists. It has even inspired me to begin learning how to play the guitar! Some of my favorite artists or bands include Frank Ocean, The Strokes, The Beatles, Queen and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Additonally, my passion for the arts has pushed me to take interest in graphic design and web design. </p>
      <p>Other than my passion for the arts, I am also very interested in health and nutrition. I started to use the gym as a healthy outlet beginning in 10th grade. Though I was still naive at 16, I picked up some weights and learned the ropes myself. As I approach my seventh year of working out, I can reflect on how thankful I am to rely on such an outlet that not only allows me to take care of myself physically but also mentally. Staying active helps me maintain a positive and productive mindset, which is such an important aspect of life to incorporate into my routine amidst all the stress from external factors like school, my career and my future. </p>

      <h2 class="mygoals">My Goals</h2>
      <p> My career path has certainly been a journey, and figuring out my goals for the future has been one of the biggest challenges I've faced during my undergraduate years. I am an out-of-state student from Memphis, Tennessee who was attracted to the University of Florida because of its large student body and abundance of resources. I completed my first two years of my undergraduate degree as a marketing major in the business school before deciding it was not for me. Though my professors were helpful, I craved creativity within my classes and yearned for a major that allowed me to express my artistic side. So, I switched to the College of Journalism and Communications and haven't looked back since!</p>
      <p>Looking forward, I am interested in pursuing a career in news reporting, PR for a nonprofit organization or web design. I love the community-first mindset of many reporters, but I know it can be a taxing career, demanding long hours and investment. Though I would love to pursue a lifetime career in reporting, I think I would like to try out multiple careers in my lifetime, which is why I am earning my master's degree in web design through UF! Hopefully I can find a career that seamlessly blends my strong suits and interests.</p>

            <p class="card-text"> Through my experience with writing for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, WUFT, The Independent Florida Alligator, the Gainesville Sun and the UF Alumni Association, I have learned so much about the world and people around me. My most notable experience, however, has probably been with St. Jude/ALSAC where I worked as a public relations intern. </p>
